What is this?
-

This is an esoteric programming language ( esolang ) called KitCoda. 

It is centered around cats, because I love them, and every command is something a cat could do. 

It is like python, except it's tiny ( 600 lines!! ) and only has a few, essential commands.

However, you can do lots of things in KitCoda! For example, you can approximate sin(x), with just its four basic math functions!

Why did I make this?
-

I made this to satisfy something for me and others: the need for a cute programming language.

How did I make this?
-

I wrote this line by line, day by day, over the course of a month.

I started by creating simple commands, like meow ( the print command ) and bap ( an if statement )

Over time, though, I added more and more commands, until I felt this was a complete esolang.

What did I learn? What did I struggle with?
-

I struggled with many bugs and errors, code not working, and with many other problems throughout this wonderful process.

However, I feel that I have learned a few things from it:
- How to make an esolang,
- Why these exist,
- How to implement a variety of commands
- Parsing
- And finally, how to get through the struggles of coding!

This is my first published, completed project.
